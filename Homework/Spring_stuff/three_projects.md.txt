Arduino Controlled Nerf Vulcan

http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controled-Nerf-Vulcan/

I chose this project because I think its one of the coolest things out of all
the projects ive seen. Being able to shoot a nerf gun from a safe distance makes it 
feel like an automated turret and I love the idea of that. For this project, I
would need to learn how to use a motor and a device to pinch the trigger.

I love the idea of automated devices or devices that can be operated from a distance,
so the concept of thhis project really appealeed to me. For this project I would need
to learn how to use the speaker more efficently n and setting up the device.

I love the rain simulation in this project which plays with your mind. When you
see this rain simulation someone would expect to be wet when passing through so it
messes with your natural body and thought process. For this project, I would have to
learn how to use cameras to judge a persos position relative to the space of the project.
