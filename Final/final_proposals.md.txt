Chopping food
Computer Turn ONer - laser sensor
Switch flipper
Thrower



A robotic arm with a blade attached to cut in a vertical motion. Machine only operates
when the button is pressed. Something to auto cut things like onions and peppers would
make my life easier.


Holder- A robotic Arm designed to grip objects that are difficult to hold and is
adjustable through commands of the robotic arms. I think something like this would
allow me to take on different angles on the object being held by the arm.

Computer Turn ONer- Turns on the computer and monitors when a button is pressed.
A laser input or button press would simplify turning on 


Thrower, takes an item off the shelf and throws it in a direction( or place the object).
The thrower can detect if items are within reach. It will attempt to grab said objects
and toss them in a set direction.
