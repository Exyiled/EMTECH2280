# Final Project - WIFI BUTTON PUSHER

## Goal: To push the button wirelessly from an app. 


By using the adafruit IO and the arduino Yun, I can activate the dvice from anywhere as long as the device is connected to the internet and plugged in. When it recieves the signal, it pushes the button on the pc.
